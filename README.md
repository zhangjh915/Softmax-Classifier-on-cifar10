# Softmax-Classifier-with-Cross-Entropy-Loss
##Description:
A Softmax classifier with cross entropy loss and regularization
on cifar10 images written in Python3.

This model uses cifar10 as the dataset. 
The dataset can be downloaded following the instrustions in 
[The CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

##Model Performance:
The final accuracy of the model is 0.3606 and the learned
weights are presented below.

## Softmax Classifier with Cross-Entropy Loss:
Softmax function takes an N-dimensional vector of real 
numbers and transforms it into a vector of real number 
in range (0,1). The softmax function outputs a probability 
distribution instead of one maximum value, making it suitable
for probabilistic interpretation in classification tasks.
The softmax function is
